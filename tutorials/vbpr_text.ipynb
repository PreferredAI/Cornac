    "We would like to use [Visual Bayesian Personalizer Ranking (VBPR)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.01784.pdf), it makes use of pre-trained visual features extracted from CNN. However, our data of interest [MovieLens dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) does not come with visual information, but instead it contains text movie plots. In this tutorial, we will employ Conac's modality infrastructures to easily utilize VBPR to leverage item text content.\n",
