# Contributing an evaluation metric to Cornac

This tutorial shows how to add an evaluation measure to Cornac. As with any contribution, we assume that we have already forked the Cornac repository.

Some evaluation measures may have different appellations in the literature. So it is worth it to make sure that the metric of interest is not already available in Cornac, before considering any contribution. Cornac's list of measures is [here](https://cornac.readthedocs.io/en/latest/metrics.html).
